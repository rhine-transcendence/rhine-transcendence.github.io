<h1>Program</h1>

<li> starting 10:30 Welcome coffee<p>
<li><b>11:00-12:00  Thomas Dreyfus (CNRS, Universit√© Strasbourg):  Differential transcendance and Galois theory </b><p>
	
In this talk we consider meromorphic solutions of difference equations and prove that very few among them satisfy an algebraic differential equation. The basic tool is the difference Galois theory of functional equations. 
<li>Lunch<p>
<li><b>14:00-15:00  Ksenia Fedosova (Freiburg): "On solutions of Bessel equations"?</b><p>
In this talk, we concentrate on automorphic functions satisfying an
inhomogeneous Laplace equation. We discuss their Fourier expansions
and, in some set-ups, give explicit expressions for their coefficients.
Interestingly enough, in the situations where we can provide explicit
solutions, the latter belong to a certain Picard-Vessiot extension of
the field of rational functions. Moreover, it turns out that these
correspond exactly to the functions appearing in the graviton
scattering in the string theory.<p>
<li>Coffee break<p>
<li><b>15:30-16:30  Gerold Schefer (Basel): Logarithmic equidistribution in small heights</b><p>
<p>Bilu's theorem about equidistribution of conjugates of algebraic numbers of small height is the prototype of many equidistribution results. It states that for any strict sequence of algebraic numbers (a_n) whose absolute logarithmic Weil height tends to zero, and any continuous and bounded function f: C* -> C the averages of the evaluations of f in the conjugates a_n of converge to the integral of f over the unit circle. In this talk we want to understand for which algebraic numbers k we still get convergence if we take the test function x -> log|x-k| . Pineiro, Szpiro and Tucker conjectured convergence for rational k. Autissier disproved it taking k = 2. Breuillard and Frey considered k = 1, for which convergence holds. Recently R. Baker and Masser showed that for every algebraic k =/= 0 which does not lie on the unit circle, convergence fails. The focus will thus be on k lying on the unit circle, not a root of unity.
