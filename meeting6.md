<li><b> <!-- 10:50-11:40 --> Stefan Ludwig: Model theory of difference fields with an additive character on the fixed field </b> <p>
What are the common properties of all finite fields expressible in first order logic (in the language of rings)? In 1968 James Ax, building on number theoretic results, answered this question and initiated the study of pseudofinite fields, the infinite models of the theory of finite fields. Ehud Hrushovski generalised Ax's theorem in two directions passing to richer structures: Finite fields equipped with an additive character and the algebraic closure of finite fields with a symbol for the Frobenius. In this talk, we will start by giving some basic notions from model theory as well as Ax's theorem and then show how to combine Hrushovski's results into one theory.

<li><b> <!-- 13:50-14:40 --> tbc </b> <p>
<!-- A few years ago, Dimitrov proved the Schinzel-Zassenhaus Conjecture. Harry Schmidt and I showed how his general strategy can be adapted to cover some dynamical variants of this conjecture. One common tool in both results is Dubinin's Theorem on the transfinite diameter of hedgehogs. Motivated by Mahler's work on root separation, I gave an elementary proof of Dubinin's Theorem, albeit with a worse numerical constant. In this talk I will report on joint work in progress with Harry Schmidt. We find new upper bounds for the transfinite diameter of some finite topological trees. These trees are more attuned to the dynamical setting then hedgehogs and cover some post-critically finite polynomials. -->

<li><b> <!-- 15:10-16:00 --> Abishek Oswal (Freiburg): p-adic hyperbolicity of the moduli space of abelian varieties </b> <p>
By a theorem of Borel, any holomorphic map from a complex algebraic variety to the moduli space of abelian varieties (and more generally to an arithmetic variety) is in fact algebraic. A key input is to prove that any holomorphic map from a product of punctured disks to such an arithmetic variety does not have any essential singularities.  
In this talk, I'll discuss a p-adic analogue of these results. This is joint work with Ananth Shankar and Xinwen Zhu (with an appendix by Anand Patel).
