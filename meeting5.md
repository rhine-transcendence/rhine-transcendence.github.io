<li><b>11:00-11:50 Andreas Demleitner (Freiburg): Rigidity of Hyperelliptic Manifolds </b> <p>
Compact flat Riemannian manifolds (i.e., quotients of *real* tori by the action of a finite group) exhibit a certain rigidity: they are uniquely determined by their fundamental group. In contrast, most compact complex manifolds "come in families", meaning that they allow for non-trivial (small) deformations. In my talk, I will introduce the concept of rigidity of compact complex manifolds and explain the existence of rigid hyperelliptic manifolds (i.e., quotients of *complex* tori by the action of a finite group). Additionally, I will outline a classification algorithm for these manifolds. This is joint work with Christian Gleissner.
