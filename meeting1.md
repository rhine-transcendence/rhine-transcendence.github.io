<li><b>10:30-11:15 Yann Bugeaud (Strasbourg):  Diophantine properties of Thue-Morse expansions </b><p>
	
The Thue-Morse word over the alphabet {a, b} is the fixed point starting with a of the morphism sending a to ab and b to ba, that is, it is the limit of the sequence of finite words a, ab, abba, abbabaab, abbabaabbaababba, â€¦ We survey the Diophantine properties of real numbers whose expansion in some integer base or whose continued fraction expansion is given by a Thue-Morse word (here, a and b are distinct positive integers). We also discuss the Diophantine properties of p-adic numbers whose Hensel expansion is a Thue-Morse word and of power series over a finite field F whose continued fraction expansion is a Thue-Morse word (here, a and b are distinct nonconstant polynomials with coefficients in F). 
<li> <b>11:30-12:00 Discussion of future plans</b><p>
<li>Lunch<p>
<li><b>14:00-14:45 Robert Wilms (Basel): On the distribution of algebraic numbers and its generalization in Arakelov geometry</b><p>
I will talk about a new equidistribution result for the roots of polynomials with bounded Bombieri norm. This can be formulated and proven in a much broader setting for the zero sets of small sections of hermitian line bundles on arithmetic varieties in any dimension. I will discuss the main ingredients of the proof coming from geometry of numbers and from complex analysis. This is work in progress.<p>
<li>Coffee break<p>
<li><b>15:30-16:15 Christoph Brackenhofer: C^1-triangulations of semi-algebraic sets</b><p>
<p>If one wants to treat integration of differential forms over semi-algebraic sets analogous to the case of smooth manifolds, it is desirable to have triangulations of semi-algebraic sets that are globally of class C^1. We will present a proof of the existence of such triangulations using the 'panel beating' method introduced by Ohmoto-Shiota (2017) and discuss possible generalizations.
